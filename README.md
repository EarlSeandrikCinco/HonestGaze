Project Overview

This project implements a command-line based data processing system developed in Python. It includes all core functionalities such as data loading, input validation, structured processing, and output generation. The system utilizes modular design principles to ensure clarity, maintainability, and extensibility. A requirements.txt file is included to specify the external Python dependencies required to run the project. This file allows users to install all necessary packages reproducibly using a single command.

Current Features

- Fully functional command-line workflow

- Input validation and structured error handling

- Modular organization of logic for readability and scalability

- Clear separation of concerns across components

- Reproducible environment setup through requirements.txt

Planned Enhancement

A simple graphical user interface (GUI) will be added in a future update. This GUI will provide a more accessible and user-friendly method for interacting with the system while preserving all existing backend logic.

How to Install Dependencies

To install the required packages, run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
